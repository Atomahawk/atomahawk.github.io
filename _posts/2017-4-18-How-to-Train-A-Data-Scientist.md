## Two years ago...
It's Summer 2015.  One whirlwind summer with two professors that championed data, and I knew I wanted to use data analytics to solve awesome problems.  I wanted to pursue a career as a data scientist.

My studies urged me advocate in support changing hearts and minds about climate change. A GIS class here and there and I wanted to specialize in geospatial data and humanitarian applications. A unique plant research experience led me to wanting innovate on IoT agtech systems. A student-run conference called iiData had me tinkering with SQL and signing up for random Coursera courses.  A class around IT Management whet my interest in analytics and strategic consulting.

Fast forward a couple months and I was recognized in a state government hackathon for wrangling the data of California's reservoirs in the context of a dam expansion.  Soon after, I was scraping data for an agtech software startup, and learning about how data impacted the 2016 presidential election through an Asian Pacific American Civic Leadership Program.

Looking forward, my faith in data science for social good in combination with the ubiquity of AI has me yearning to drive policy and industry standards in support of friendly AI.  Oh yeah, and then there's the blockchain, computer vision, natural language processing, and a whole wide world of computational statistics specializations and applications. :tired_face:  :tired_face:  :tired_face:

Not like I'm learning it all at once - but the vast expanse of everything I just don't know (but on the fringe of understanding) is incredibly humbling and empowering. :triumph: I want to learn it all.

Frankly, I decided an accredited bootcamp was for me after the 2016 Open Data Science Conference in Santa Clara.  Metis was tabling, as were other data science bootcamp programs.  The workshops were a bit over my head, and the capabilities of data scientists around me were sky high. I left with many role models, and a huge thirst for professional mentorship.

But finding and working with a well-qualified data scientist was a completely different story.  Instead of fighting desperately, it was easier to jump head first into the vast ocean of tech innovation in the SoMa district of San Francisco.  It's easier to hustle when you're at the center of a strong community.

## At Metis in San Francisco, it's trial by :fire: 

For a workaholic like me, it's almost a dream come true. Unfairly short deadlines combined with an seemingly endless list of resources and things to learn.  It's like a digital Disneyland - moving from scary rides to awesome rides at the speed of stamina and mental energy.

Do I get tired?  Oh hell yeah.  Overwhelmed?  You bet.  But at least I'm here, I make progress every day, and I'm focused.  There's no way the incredible pyramid of support, encouragement, and privilege I've had up until this point will be wasted on me in the weeks to come.

No matter the sector, industry, or niche - I'm going to keep skilling up until I make data products my b.

## This first week was a doozy.

It reminds me a lot of the data studies program at UC Davis.  (To any UC Davis undergraduates, studying under [Duncan Temple Lang](http://www.stat.ucdavis.edu/~duncan/) and [Joe Dumit](http://socialscience.ucdavis.edu/about-iss/people/joseph-dumit-director) was hands down, the greatest experience of my undergraduate career).  In one week, we acquired, cleaned, explored, and presented a unique business offering using python, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. It wasn't meant to be mindblowingly deep, but it was meant to be instructive.  Check out my [week 1 project](https://github.com/Atomahawk/benson)!

Apart from the academics, it feels a bit like camping. Since I can't afford to indulge in the cuisine of SoMa on the daily, I meal prep for the week and take working lunches everyday - but not without its rewards.  I appreciate my fellow cohort members, and I especially admire how many of us came in on the weekend to continue working on things.  There's something to this 'ride or die' mentality across a group of people who aren't afraid of getting their butts kicked by messy data and broken code.

From here on out, there's three individual projects and one more group project.  This thing called data science, It's not rocket science.

*To close, here's a thought that I embraced prior to my bootcamp on the "need for warriors."*

> The need for warriors and the nature for who has to fight hasn't evolved much and likely won't change in any near future. Drones, stealth, atomic warfare, and high-tech weaponry won't change this. There will always be the need for young men and women who are willing and able to step up and do the hard things. Nations need this.

> Normal people can't do the things warriors are asked to do. They can't imagine it and shouldn't be forced to. But there are those that do. For these people though, there must be a transition from "civilian" to "warrior." Boot camp is the means of that evolution, and every part of it is necessary. 

```Here's to growing as a human.```
